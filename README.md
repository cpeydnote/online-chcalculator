Online Temporary Structure Calculator

OTSC is the first structural design platform for temporary works built with AI Vibe Coding technology, tailored specifically for the construction industry.

In real-world projects, many temporary or provisional structures—such as single beams, simple frames, or temporary walkways—only require minimal structural checks. Yet, the current process often involves paying consultants and waiting several days just to receive a basic OK/NG result. This results in high time and financial costs.

OTSC was created to address this inefficiency. By entering a few key parameters—such as dimensions and loading—users can instantly receive a preliminary structural verification result, clearly indicating whether the configuration is acceptable (OK/NG). Powered by AI algorithms and structural logic, OTSC dramatically shortens decision-making time and brings efficient, reliable assistance to the field.

Fast input, instant check — OTSC is the structural verification tool built for the jobsite.
